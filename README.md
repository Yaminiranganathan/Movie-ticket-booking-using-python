#Movie-Ticket-Booking-System-Using-Python

##Objective
##The major objectives of the project are as follows:

-> To provide a simple command-line interface for booking movie tickets.

-> To allow users to select a language, choose a movie, and select showtimes and ticket prices.

-> To confirm ticket bookings with a generated OTP for security.

##Existing System
-> Users manually visit movie theaters or use online platforms to book tickets.

-> Data is often viewed and processed through websites or mobile applications.

-> Users have to manually refresh the page or visit frequently to get updated information on available movies and showtimes.

##Proposed System
-> The proposed system automates the process of booking movie tickets with a command-line interface.

-> Users can choose their preferred language, select from a list of available movies, and choose showtimes and ticket prices.

-> The system confirms ticket bookings by generating and displaying an OTP.

##Features
-> Language Selection: Users can choose their preferred language (e.g., Tamil, English) to book a ticket.

-> Movie Selection: Users can select from a list of available movies based on their chosen language.

-> Location Selection: Users can choose from a list of available locations for the selected movie.

-> Theater Selection: Users can select from a list of theaters in the chosen location.

-> Showtime Selection: Users can choose from available showtimes for the selected movie.

-> Ticket Price Selection: Users can select from available ticket prices for the chosen showtime.

-> OTP Confirmation: The system generates an OTP to confirm the ticket booking.

##Future Enhancement
-> The project can be expanded to include a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.

-> Integration with online payment gateways for secure and convenient ticket purchases.

-> Adding support for more languages and movies to cater to a wider audience.

-> Implementing features like seat selection and special offers for an enhanced booking experience.
